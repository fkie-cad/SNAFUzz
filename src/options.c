// VSM only works partially:
// 
// The system can boot with Virtualization Based Security (VBS) enabled.
// VTL calls are implemented and work fine, but I don't see a good way to implement `HvModifyVtlProtectionMask`,
// which is sort of the main point of VBS. Fundamentally, we would need to be able have two physical memory mappings,
// one for each VTL, as the permissions are different between the two VTL.
// 
// I don't see a way to do this with the Hypervisor Platform APIs. There is probably a way if we go to the undocumented Vid.dll.
// 
// This means while VBS is running, there is no real separation between VTL 0 and VTL 1.
// This is not be much of a problem, except when trying run with HVCI enabled.
// If HVCI is enabled, the Secure Kernel Patch Guard (or Skpg, or Hyperguard) is also enabled.
// During its initialization, it tests that kernel pages are actually protected, by writing to a page and then executing it.
// The function that is being written and then executed is `KiErrata671Present`.
// If the write was successful, it return 0, otherwise it returns 1.
// 
// For us this will incorrectly return 0, and shortly thereafter Skpg will cause a CRITICAL_INITIALIZATION_FAILURE bugcheck.
